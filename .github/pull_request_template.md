## Hey there 👋
First of all, thanks for opening this PR! The Python community appreciates ❤️🐍

## The Checklist (for communities) ✅
We all love checklists, right? Please, make sure that the PR has everything we need:
- [ ] The community is a local community, and not a conference. This is not a map for events in a certain point in time!
- [ ] The community added has a `name`, `lat`, `lng` and `url`
- [ ] The URL is working. No 404 pleeeeeeeeeease!
- [ ] The tests are passing

## The Checklist (for other things) ✅
We still don't have a process here, so:
- [ ] The tests are passing 🤷‍♀️

❤️
